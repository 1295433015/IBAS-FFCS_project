MRI Fat Fraction Analysis and Segmentation Project

Overview

This project is designed for analyzing and segmenting MRI images to calculate the fat fraction in different anatomical structures. It includes various modules for preprocessing data, training machine learning models, performing inference on new data, and calculating performance metrics for model evaluation.

Project Structure

	•	src/data_loader.py: Handles the loading and preprocessing of MRI image data, preparing it for training, validation, and testing.
	•	src/inference.py: Implements the inference pipeline using trained models to predict segmentation masks on new data.
	•	src/metrics_configs.py: Defines the tasks path for calculating metrics used to evaluate the performance of the segmentation models.
	•	src/metrics.py: Provides custom metric calculation functions such as Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, and Hausdorff distance 95 to evaluate segmentation performance.
	•	src/model.py: Contains the definition and configuration of the neural network models used for segmentation, including 3D UNet and other variants.
	•	src/train.py: The script used for training the models. It includes functions for setting up the data loaders, initializing the model, training the model, and validating it.
	•	preprocess/main.py: The main entry point for running different stages of the project, including training, inference, and evaluation.
	•	preprocess/preprocess.py: Provides preprocessing steps such as resampling and cropping of MRI images to prepare them for model input.
	•	fat_fraction_calculation.py: Contains functions to calculate the fat fraction from MRI images using fat and water images with corresponding masks.

Setup and Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:
	git clone https://github.com/1295433015/IBAS-FFCS_project.git
    cd yourprojectname
	2.	Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
	python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Usage
Data Preprocessing
	Before training or inference, ensure that your MRI data is preprocessed correctly. Run the preprocessing script:
		python preprocess.py

Training
	To train the model, execute the following command:
		python train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
	You can adjust the configuration parameters in the train_config.yaml file.

Inference
	To run inference on new MRI data:
		python inference.py --input_dir /path/to/input --output_dir /path/to/output --model_path /path/to/model.pth


Metrics Evaluation
	To evaluate the model using custom metrics:
		python metrics.py --config metrics_configs.py --output /path/to/save/metrics.xlsx


Fat Fraction Calculation
	To calculate the fat fraction in the MRI images:
		python fat_fraction_calculation.py --data_root /path/to/data --mask_root /path/to/masks --save_file /path/to/save.xlsx
